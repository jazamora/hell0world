			<h2>The Need for Computer Science Education</h2>
			<p><img class="right" src="images/graph2.png" alt="">By 2020, there will be 1.4 
			million software jobs in the US, and over 80% of these jobs will be left unfilled. 
			Hispanics and Blacks currently comprise of only 5.2% and 4% of these software jobs, respectively, 
			according to the 2012 Bureau of Labor Statistics.<br/>
			<br/>
			In a society where technology plays increasingly important roles, if these trends continue, 
			our Hispanic and Black youths are facing a future where their role in society is edged out.<br/>
			<br/> 
			An education in computer science not only gets students off the streets, it’ll open doors 
			to an exciting career and limitless opportunities.

				<h2>HOLA - Heart of Los Angeles</h2>
				<p>In neighborhoods often overrun by poverty, 
				crime and a feeling of hopelessness, Heart of Los Angeles invests in youth to build 
				stronger communities. Heart of Los Angeles gives some of the city’s most vulnerable 
				youth a chance to succeed in life.<br/>
				<br/>
				From what started 25 years ago with just a handful 
				of kids in a dilapidated gym, Heart of Los Angeles now serves over 2,400 youth ages 
				6-24, in a safe and supportive environment. HOLA provides underserved youth with 
				exceptional programs in academics, arts and athletics within a nurturing environment, 
				empowering them to develop their potential, pursue their education and strengthen 
				their communities.<br/>
				<br> 
				Heart of Los Angeles operates on a 32,000 square foot campus in the Rampart District, 
				one of the nation’s most densely populated and diverse neighborhoods. HOLA’s students 
				are approximately 85% Latino, 7% Asian American, 6% African American and 2% other 
				ethnicities.<br/>
				<br/>
				Of the families that HOLA serves, 90% are living in poverty while all 
				struggle each day to simply survive. HOLA operates Monday through Saturday year round 
				and all programs are free, an essential feature for the area's impoverished families.<br/>  
				<br/>
				HOLA’s facilities include multiple classrooms, a state-of-the-art field turf soccer 
				field, a full gymnasium and indoor athletic facility, multiple education and fine 
				arts libraries, an art studio and gallery, music and orchestra rooms, three computer 
				labs and a science, technology and digital media center.
